# A simple qsys plugin that allows you to check if the design has been changed.

This plugin allows you to check basic information about the core and see if your design has changed and when, directly in your design.
This can be useful when you don't have access to the core and only to your design, so you can check for example which version of Q-SYS 
you were using when you last downloaded the design, if someone changed the design you can compare the timestamp of your version with the current 
version that is in the core.


## Features

Displays information directly in the design such as:

- Q-SYS Version
- Plataform(Core Model)
- Design Name
- Design Code(ID)
- Timestamp last design
- Timestamp last boot
- Core IP/Mac


## Installation

Just install the QSYSCoreAudit.qplug file and add it to your design.
